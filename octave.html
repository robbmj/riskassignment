For my research project I have chosen to examine the risk assessment methodology named, OCTAVE.
OCTAVE is an acronym for "Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation"
</P>
<p>
OCTAVE was and continues to be developed by CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) a registered trade mark owned
 by Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.
</P>
<p>
OCTAVE  is a suite of tools, techniques, and methods for risk-based information security strategic assessment and planning.
</P>
<p>
The OCTAVE Method uses a three-phased approach to examine organizational and technology issues, assembling a comprehensive picture of the organization's information security needs.
</P>
<p>
It is comprised of a series of workshops, either facilitated or conducted by an interdisciplinary analysis team of three to five of the organization's own personnel. The method takes advantage of knowledge from multiple levels of the organization, focusing on
</P>
<p>
<ul>
<li>identifying critical assets and the threats to those assets</li>
<li>identifying the vulnerabilities, both organizational and technological, that expose those threats, creating risk to the organization</li>
<li>developing a practice-based protection strategy and risk mitigation plans to support the organization's mission and priorities</li>
</ul>
</P>
<p>
These activities are supported by a catalog of good or known practices, as well as surveys and worksheets that can be used to elicit and capture information during focused discussions and problem-solving sessions.
